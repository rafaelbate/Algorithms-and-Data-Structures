# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

Introduction of the concepts of abstract data types, algorithms and basic data structures as essential tools to solve problems in a structured and efficient way. Two habits are particularly exercised in developing programs for specific problems: structuring solutions in abstract data types, and choose appropriate algorithms and data structures to the problem in question, in order to have efficient solutions.
